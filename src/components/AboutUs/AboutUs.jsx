            <p className='para-body'>
              We started in the year 2019, with our domestic operations of
              supplying HIGH E.C. Coir Pth Blocks, to the local nurseries in and
              around Pune. We come from a background of generations of
              farmers/land owners, with rich experience in the agriculture
              industry. <br />
              We are relatively new in the Coir Industry, but we have a fresh
              outlook, and a strong and organised apprach to everything that we
              do. Our results and the quality of our product speaks for itself,
              and we aim to satisfy our clients with the best service in the
              industry.
